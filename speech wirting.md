# Speech Writing 📝🎤

### **1. 🎯 Introduction & Goal**

* **Topic:** Speech Writing.
* **Objective:** To learn the correct format, tense, and structure to score **full marks (5/5)** in exams. 💯

### **2. 📏 The Perfect Format (Step-by-Step)**
* **Heading:** Must be written in **CAPITAL LETTERS** at the top center. Don't write just the first letter capital; capitalize the whole heading! 🔠
* **Opening Lines (Memorize This!):** Start every speech with this fixed phrase:
    > *"Good Morning Respected Principal, Teachers, and all my dear friends. My name is [Name]. Today I am here to express my views on the topic [Topic Name]."* 🗣️
    * *Note:* If the name is not given in the question, use "XYZ".
* **Opening Gratitude:** Add a line thanking the organizers: *"First, I would like to thank the organization for giving me an opportunity to express my views in front of you."* 🙏

### **3. 🏗️ Body Structure (4 Paragraphs)**
The speech should be divided into **4 distinct paragraphs**:
* **Paragraph 1:** The formal greeting and opening lines (as mentioned above). 👋
* **Paragraph 2 (Intro & Positives):** Introduce the topic in 2-3 lines. Discuss the **Positive sides/Good effects** (Pros). 👍
* **Paragraph 3 (Negatives):** Discuss the **Negative sides/Bad effects** (Cons). Every topic usually has two sides (e.g., Social Media). 👎
* **Paragraph 4 (Conclusion):** Sum up by balancing the positive and negative points. Give a solution or a balanced opinion. ⚖️

### **4. 🏁 The Closing (Mandatory)**
* End the speech with this fixed line:
    > *"At the end, I would like to thank everyone for listening to me carefully."* 👂
* Leave one line blank and write **"Thank You"**. ✍️

### **5. ⏳ Important Rules & Tips**
* **Tense:** Mostly use **Present Tense** (since speeches usually discuss current topics). Use Past Tense only if describing a specific past event/accident. 🕰️
* **Word Limit:** Stick to **150 - 200 words**. 🚫
* **Marking Scheme (Total 5 Marks):**
    * Format: 1 Mark 1️⃣
    * Content: 2 Marks 2️⃣
    * Accuracy (Grammar): 1 Mark 1️⃣
    * Organization of Ideas: 1 Mark 1️⃣

### **6. 📱 Example Discussed: "Impact of Social Media"**
* **Intro:** Social media is a powerful tool (Instagram, WhatsApp).
* **Positives:** Connects friends, learning skills, online education, staying updated. 🌍
* **Negatives:** Laziness, lack of concentration in studies, anxiety, sleep problems, cyberbullying. 😴
* **Conclusion:** Use it in a balanced way; focus on real-life friends and studies. ⚖️

### 🍔 **Final Notes Details Summary (The "Burger" Analogy)**

To remember Speech Writing forever, just think of it as making a **Burger**:

* **The Top Bun (The Format & Heading):** This is the first thing people see. It must be big and clear (Capital Letter Heading). Without this, the burger falls apart.
* **The Special Sauce (The Opening Hook):** This is the flavor starter. "Good Morning Respected Principal..." — You put this sauce on *every* burger (speech) you make. It never changes!
* **The Filling (The Body - 3 Layers):**
    * **Layer 1 (The Meat/Veggies):** The core content. Start with the **Positive** tasty stuff.
    * **Layer 2 (The Spice):** The **Negative** aspects or challenges.
    * **Layer 3 (The Cheese/Binding):** The **Conclusion**. It melts the positives and negatives together into a balanced opinion.
* **The Bottom Bun (The Closing):** "Thank you for listening..." followed by "Thank You." This holds the whole burger together so the contents don't spill out at the end.

**Remember:** **Top Bun** (Heading) + **Sauce** (Greeting) + **Filling** (Positives/Negatives/Conclusion) + **Bottom Bun** (Thank You) = **Full Marks!** 🍔✅

I have used the exact "Burger Format":  **Heading (CAPS) + Greeting + Body (Intro/Pros/Cons/Conclusion) + Closing.**

### **Example 1: School Life Topic**
*Topic: The importance of discipline in a student's life.*

**THE IMPORTANCE OF DISCIPLINE**

Good Morning Respected Principal, Teachers, and all my dear friends. My name is [Your Name]. Today I am here to express my views on the topic "The Importance of Discipline."

First, I would like to thank the organization for giving me an opportunity to express my views in front of you. Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. It means following rules and behaving in a controlled way.

Discipline brings stability to our lives. It helps us focus on our studies, manage our time effectively, and respect others. A disciplined student is always appreciated by teachers and parents. It is the key to success in every field, whether it is sports or academics.

However, a lack of discipline leads to chaos. Without it, we waste time, leave tasks incomplete, and face failure. Some students feel that discipline takes away their freedom, but in reality, it teaches us how to enjoy freedom responsibly.

To conclude, discipline is not a burden but a habit that shapes our character. We must practice self-discipline to achieve our dreams. At the end, I would like to thank everyone for listening to me carefully.

Thank You.

### **Example 2: Current Trends Topic**
*Topic: Is Online Learning good or bad?*

**ONLINE LEARNING: BOON OR BANE?**

Good Morning Respected Principal, Teachers, and all my dear friends. My name is [Your Name]. Today I am here to express my views on the topic "Online Learning: Boon or Bane?"

First, I would like to thank the organization for giving me an opportunity to express my views in front of you. Since the pandemic, education has shifted from classrooms to screens, changing how we learn.

On the positive side, online learning allows us to learn from the comfort of our homes. It saves travel time and gives us access to unlimited resources and videos on the internet. We can learn at our own pace and revisit recorded lectures if we have doubts.

On the negative side, spending too much time on screens causes eye strain and headaches. Many students lose focus and start playing games instead of studying. Also, we miss the fun of meeting friends and the physical activities we do in school.

In conclusion, online learning is a great tool if used wisely. We must balance it with physical activities and honest studying. At the end, I would like to thank everyone for listening to me carefully.

Thank You.

### **Example 3: Social Awareness Topic**
*Topic: The harmful effects of plastic bags.*

**SAY NO TO PLASTIC**

Good Morning Respected Principal, Teachers, and all my dear friends. My name is [Your Name]. Today I am here to express my views on the topic "Say No to Plastic."

First, I would like to thank the organization for giving me an opportunity to express my views in front of you. Plastic has become a part of our daily lives, but it is destroying our planet.

People use plastic bags because they are cheap, light, and easy to carry. They are waterproof and durable. However, the damage they cause is much greater than their benefits.

Plastic is non-biodegradable, meaning it stays on Earth for hundreds of years. It chokes drains, causes floods, and pollutes the soil. Innocent animals like cows and stray dogs often eat plastic bags and die. Burning plastic also releases poisonous gases into the air.

To conclude, it is our duty to save our environment. We should switch to cloth or jute bags and stop using single-use plastics immediately. Small steps can make a big difference. At the end, I would like to thank everyone for listening to me carefully.

Thank You.

### 💡 **Quick Tips for your Exam:**
1.  **Don't forget the CAPS:** The heading *must* be capital letters (e.g., **SAY NO TO PLASTIC**).
2.  **Stick to the script:** The opening and closing lines are your "free marks." Don't change them!
3.  **Paragraphs:** Make sure the examiner can *see* 3 or 4 separate paragraphs. Don't write one big block of text.
